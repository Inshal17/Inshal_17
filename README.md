## Why learn Python?

Python has become the go-to language for data professionals, and here‚Äôs why:

* **Versatility:** Python is used in data analysis, machine learning, web development, and automation. Its simplicity makes it beginner-friendly yet powerful for experts.
* **Data Analysis:** Libraries like `Pandas`, `NumPy`, and `Matplotlib` simplify data cleaning, analysis, and visualization for any dataset.
* **Data Science:** Tools like `Scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`, and `PyTorch` enable machine learning, statistical analysis, and solving complex problems.
* **Data Engineering:** Python integrates with tools like `Apache Airflow`, `PySpark`, and `SQLAlchemy` for building and managing data pipelines.
* **Job Opportunities:** Python skills are in high demand for roles like data analyst, data scientist, and data engineer.
* **Community Support:** Python‚Äôs large community offers endless tutorials, forums, and resources to help you grow.

  ## Course Structure

This course is divided into two sprints, each designed to build your Python skills step by step:

### Sprint 1: Python Basics

In the first sprint, you‚Äôll learn the foundational concepts of Python, including:
- **Data Types:** Strings, integers, floats, and booleans.
- **Variables:** Storing and manipulating data.
- **Arithmetic Operators:** Performing calculations.
- **Conditions:** Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to make decisions.
- **Functions:** Writing reusable blocks of code.

By the end of this sprint, you‚Äôll have a solid understanding of Python basics and be ready to tackle more advanced topics.

### Sprint 2: Intermediate Python

In the second sprint, you‚Äôll dive deeper into Python‚Äôs powerful features, including:
- **Strings:** Manipulating and formatting text.
- **Booleans:** Working with `True` and `False` values.
- **Lists:** Storing and managing collections of data.
- **Loops:** Automating repetitive tasks with `for` and `while` loops.
- **Dictionaries:** Storing data in key-value pairs.
- **Tuples and Sets:** Working with immutable and unique collections.
